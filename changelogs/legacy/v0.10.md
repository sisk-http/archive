# v.0.10.0

- Added: `ContentLength` property for `HttpRequest` objects.
- Added: `Close()` method for `HttpRequest` objects.
- Added: `OptionsLogMode` flag for the HTTP server.
- Added: `IncludeFullPathOnLog` flag for the HTTP server.
- Changed: the CORS `Allow-Origin` was an array accepting multiple values. The `AllowOrigins` property was renamed and modified to be an
`string? AllowOrigin` instead previous `string[] AllowOrigins`. You might change your service configuration in order of this change. Also was
fixed that this method allows nullable for now.
- Changed: exceptions thrown from an request handler body will now be supressed if `ThrowExceptions` is enabled.
- Fixed: the `X-Powered-By` header wasn't being sent. You can disable it by turning `HttpServerFlags.SendSiskHeader` to false.
- Fixed: `charset` on Content-Type wasn't being set by `StringContent` helper.
- Fixed: Multipart-form objects were decoding unicode chars to their wrong format. To fix this, we've added two static properties
to the `MultipartObject` ("DefaultContentEncoding" and "DefaultHeadersEncoding"), which you can set the default encoding for header-parsing and content parsing.
- Rewrited: the request id generator function to another one a bit faster than `Guid.NewGuid()`.
- Experimental: you can send custom HTTP status codes and reason phrases using the `HttpResponse.CustomStatus` property.
- Code cleanup.
