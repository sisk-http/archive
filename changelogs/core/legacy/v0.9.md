# v.0.9.0

- Removed the `Newtonsoft.Json` dependency.
- Added XML doc to the `HttpServerFlags` constructor.
- You can setup HTTP server flags on `ServiceProvider` now.
- Routes cannot be added if an route with exact or similar path is already
defined.
- Defining routes paths must start with an `/`. Sisk's current routing
implementation ignores the trailing `/` at the end of the request path and the route path.
