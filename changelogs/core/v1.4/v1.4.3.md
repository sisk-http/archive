# v1.4.3

Content compression:

- Added the `HttpServerConfiguration.EnableAutomaticResponseCompression` property.

Streaming:

- Removed the `GetLinkedCancellationSource` method for both `HttpRequestEventSource` and `HttpWebSocket` classes which was added in v1.4.2. Sorry for that!

Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue where closing web-socket `WaitNext` methods were not returning after the WS connection being closed.
- Fixed an issue where multiple WS messages were being discarded when using `WaitNext`, because they were not enqueued. Now it is enqueued.
- Fixed an issue where empty WS messages were closing the connection by the server side.
- Fixed an issue where the HTTP server weren't treating HEAD requests as GET requests to GET routes.
- Fixed an issue where the HTTP server was allowing sending content in prohibited methods (HEAD and CONNECT).
- Fixed an issue where the `HttpServerExecutionResult.Response` were always null.
- Fixed an issue where the access log were not correctly logging HTTP response status codes.
- Removed the obsolete `HttpServerConfiguration.DefaultCultureInfo` property.
